# C Programs Collection Repository

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of small C programs that I developed over a period of 2 years during my studies. These programs, which were given as exercises by teachers, have been quickly organized and pushed to be stored for future reference and as a personal memento.

Please note that the programs in this collection vary in quality. While some are well-structured and functional, others may still require further testing. It's important to mention that most of the programs are intended to run on Linux, but there are a few specifically designed for Windows.

While this repository already contains a substantial number of C programs, there are still more to come! 
Additionally, there will be separate repositories dedicated to Python and Java programs. However, before pushing them, I need to clean up the dependencies and improve the code's readability.

I'm working on it when i have spare time organizing the code and ensuring that the dependencies are cleaned. Once everything is cleaned up and the code is easier to understand, I will push the programs to their respective repositories.
